Hey there! I'm **Gautam**, a 14-year-old student, passionate about startups, software, and open source.

I've been building software for multiple years now, and have built many projects, both open-source and for companies. I mainly focus on full-stack/mobile/systems engineering, building consumer apps, and open-source tooling, though I dabble in DevOps and cloud infrastructure.

Momentarily, Iâ€™m working as a product engineer at [Foyer](https://foyer.work), helping build Merlin, an AI-powered assistant for the web.

I'm also building [Tripley](https://tripley.app/), a platform that enables travelers to plan and manage their trips.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [neusleep](https://neusleep.com), a venture-funded startup developing wearables that use personalized electrical nerve stimulation to directly induce and improve natural sleep.
