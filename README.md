Hey there! I'm **Gautam**, a 14-year-old student, passionate about startups, software, and open source.

I've been building software for multiple years now, and have experience in various projects, including both open-source and for companies. My main focus is full-stack engineering, primarily in React.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, and also systems programming in Rust. I also have experience in mobile development, DevOps, and cloud technologies.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a product engineer at [Foyer](https://foyer.work), helping maximize the performance of engineering teams.

I'm also building [Tripley](https://tripley.app/), a platform that enables travelers to plan and manage their trips.

If you're interested in chatting about anything software-related or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! You can reach me through:
