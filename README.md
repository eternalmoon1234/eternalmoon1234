Hey there! I'm **Gautam**, a 14-year-old software engineer who loves to work on exciting and impactful projects.

I've been building my skills for multiple years now, with experience in various projects, including open source and companies. My main focus is full-stack engineering, primarily through React.js, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. I also have experience in mobile development, systems programming, DevOps, and cloud technologies.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a product engineer at [Foyer](https://foyer.work), helping maximize the performance of engineering teams.

I'm also building [Tripley](https://tripley.app/), a platform that helps travelers to plan and manage their trips.
